At the beginig we need to creat a new GitHub repository by (git init)
then should clone it to a new directory by (git clone "repository URL")

for browsing the repository we use (git status) to the working tree status and the files in there.
and the (git log) to see the history and (get diff) to see the changes between commits
then they creat a new branch by using (branch). 

after that if they want to make changes the can update the repository by (git pull ) and this will download 
the files from the repository to the sand box file 

after pulling they can change the code by adding or deleting and then can use (git add -A) to add all the 
files in the repository folder then the can commit by (git commit -m"the commit massage")

then they can publish the folder by (git push) to upload it in the github repositoy.

and they went to revert before publishing the can by usying (git reset) to remove all changes.
